# Building a Tic-Tac-Toe web application involves several key components, including the structure of the game board, the styling, and the game logic. Below is a theoretical overview followed by a step-by-step process for implementing the application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Theoretical Overview
Game Structure: The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns placing their markers (X and O). The objective is to get three markers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Game Logic:
Track the game state, including the current player's turn and the status of each cell in the grid. Handle player clicks to update the grid. Check for win conditions after each turn. Optionally, implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.

# Step-by-Step Process
Set Up the HTML Structure Create a basic HTML file to structure the game board.
Style the Game with CSS Create a styles.css (tic.css) file to add some basic styles to the game.
Implement Game Logic with JavaScript Create a script.js (tic.js) file to handle the game logic.
